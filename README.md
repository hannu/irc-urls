IRC-URLs
========

This is the full source-code of the IRC-URLs project that was live 2009-2011. Main idea is to offer digg-like user interface for links mentioned in IRC channels.

Source code includes

* Full featured and finished UI
* User registration and authentication with email-password pairs
* Delayed jobs to process links - modular thumbnailer to support multiple image sites as well as oembed standard
* RSpec unit tests
* Irssi-client for automatically send links and client authentication with changeable client key
